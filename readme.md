# Overview
This tutorial introduces the USB to SSI/SPI bridge focusing on connecting and a single register read.  The example steps through the software side only (not the embedded SPI / SSI side interfaces) illistrating how a software engineer can get up and running quickly with Python and libusb1.0.  The basic architecture of the bridge is also discussed as well as an internal configuration register access.
